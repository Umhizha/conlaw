          I have always questioned the sexual innuendos and societal conventions
          that surround womanhood. What does it mean to be a woman today in
          Zimbabwe where the patriarchal perspective repeatedly leaves many
          women feeling powerless and only seen as sexual objects?

          I often employ bras as a metaphor for women’s radical resistance to
          patriarchy. I make pieces that I feel reflect not only my state of
          mind but also the state of the economy. The second hand market where I
          source materials, is important because it is a reflection of a
          critical situation –what circumstances lead to the need to invest in
          worn underwear or in the business of selling worn underwear? In
          finding and choosing this material I then try to beautify it, as if to
          hide the shame which most may attach to the idea of buying worn
          underwear. Paying particular attention to feminine material such as
          linen and underwear, my work expresses issues that surround
          professions that society deems or label scandalous, such as sex work
